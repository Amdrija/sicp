set-to-wow! on z1 will take the car of z1, which is (a b) and set its car to wow.
Since cdr of z1 also points to the same pair, its car will also be wow.

set-to-wow! on z2 will just set the car of z2 to wow, but cdr of z2 points to a different
pair with the same (a b) values, so its car is not set to wow.
