In the second example with let, there will be an additional environment created.
The first environement is from the make-withdraw call.
The second environement is from the let and it references the make-withdraw call.

Then, after the value is bound, both environemnts are accessible (which means that
initial amount will also be accessible inside the lambda)

The local states of the 2 objects are stored in different environments (stack frames).
