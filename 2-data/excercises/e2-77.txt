The package doesn't expose the magnitude for complex numbers
What is needed is to install a method magnitude for 'complex type
(put 'real-part '(complex) real-part)
(put 'imag-part '(complex) imag-part)
(put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude)
(put 'angle '(complex) angle)

Then, you define a procedure
(define (magnitude z) (apply-generic 'magnitude z))
Now, it will now that there is a procedure 'magnitude for 'complex type.
apply-generic is called twice, first to get the magnitude function
for the 'complex type and then to get the 'magnitude function for
the 'polar or 'rectangular type.
