Extending the system

Generic operations with explicit dispatch:
Adding a new type - needs to change all generic operations to add new clause - lost of changes
Adding a new operations - needs to implement it for all the types, 1 change

Data-directed style (virtual table)
Adding a new type - needs to implement the operations just for that type and install them - the generic operations dont change
Adding a new operation - each type needs to implement this operations on its own and install it

Message-passing
Adding a new type - needs to implement operations just for that type - 1 change
Adding a new operations - each type adds the operation to the dispatch function - generic operations not impacted

When adding new operatiosn - generic operations is better, because you change it only at 1 place
When adding new types - data-directed style / message passing better, because you change it only at 1 place
